If you negotiate on the inside, it might end up going to the target and not the gateway.\r\n\r\nThat is, this is much like #5: we will need to be careful.",

If we look at OHTTP _without_ chunking, there is no max size (other than the number of bytes that can be in the outer stream/body. If we view chunking as a way to allow incremental processing of something that otherwise would be one larger OHTTP message, it will always be strictly less memory than it would have been otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt is a good point that a particular chunk size could fingerprint a client if it was very consistent; similarly, the chunk size could reveal information to the relay about the contents (although the overall message size can too).",
